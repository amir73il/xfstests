# Check open by connectable file handle after cycle mount.

# This is a variant of test 477 with connectable file handles.
# This test uses load and store of file handles from a temp file to test
# decoding file handles after cycle mount and after directory renames.
# Decoding connectable file handles after being moved to a new parent
# is expected to fail.
